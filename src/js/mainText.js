        content:'The rigid cabinet construction is important to optimize the working environment for both woofers and tweeter. The organically shaped design increases overall rigidity and severely reduces cabinet resonances. Furthermore standing waves are practically eliminated as there are no parallel surfaces reflecting sound waves. The EPICON cabinet consists of real wood veneer which is lacquered of a total of 10 times. Each layer is hand polished to ensure a deep, high gloss and elegant surface. 10 times of lacquer also ensures a sturdy finish with a thickness of almost 2 mm.'
